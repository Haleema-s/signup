## Overview
The chalenge was focused on JS we were asked to build a signup-page. The signup-form is expexcted to be mobile and desktop responsive.
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process
The journey was not smooth but "nothing comes easy". I hope iwas able to produce something close if not similar to the idea we were given.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JS library
- regex

### What I learned
The thing i learnt so far was CSS and JS took much of time. The validation form in JS.

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => 
  function showError(input, message) {
    const parent = input.parentElement;
    const error = parent.querySelector('.error-message');
    error.textContent = message;
    error.style.display = 'block';
    input.style.borderColor = '#ff6f61';
  }
```
